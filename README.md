# Iss-Overhead-Notifier
API Endpoints and API Parameters

This is the international space station and it floats high above in the sky and it circles earth many, many times a day. And what we're going to try to do is we're going to try and track where the ISS
is currently at in the sky. And at the time point
when the ISS is in the night sky, right above where we are,
then we're going to send ourselves an email
telling us to look up and spot the fast-moving ISS.
